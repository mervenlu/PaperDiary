Each day, I read a paper and write a few line about it.

The list of papers are divided into groups by their fields.

1. [Speech and Natural Language Processing](nlp-papers.md)
2. [Computer Vision](computer-vision.txt)
3. [Computational Analysis of Human Behavior](human-behavior.txt)
4. [Deep Learning](deep-learning.txt)
