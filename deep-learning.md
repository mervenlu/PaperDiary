* [A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf)
    * propose an alternative generator architecture from the idea of style transfer 
    * Style transfer: modifying the style of an image while still preserving its content (like a dog photo in a cubic style)
    * Difference from style-transfer: the spatially invariant style y is calculated from a vector from an intermediate latent space instead of an image
    * A mapping network is used to map the intermediate latent space and the input latent space.
